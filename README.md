# Loan Interest Calculator
This app allows you to quickly visualize the interest accrued for a loan. Interest is charged daily on outstanding balance.
This project is meant to show my ability to develop React apps.

A live version can be found [here](https://loan-interest-calculator.herokuapp.com/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run this app, enter `npm install` in your project directory, followed by `npm start`.
Basic tests can be run by entering `npm test`.
